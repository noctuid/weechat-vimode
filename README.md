vimode
======
Just forked this since I'll be using my own customized bindings..
Great idea and script.

##Changes:
- Changed y/copy stuff to copy to clipboard (-b flag; + register in vim)
- Changed p to paste from clipboard using the weechat xsel script (which I've modified to use clipboard)
- Modified for colemak (n and e for up and down)
- Set f to do link hinting with termite using shell.py to send link hint key combo
- Added some other custom bindings (i.e. for buffer switching with space prefix bindings)
- Added tmux bindings
