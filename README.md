vimode
======
Just forked this since I'll be using my own customized bindings..
Great idea and script.

##Changes:
- Changed y/copy stuff to copy to clipboard (-b flag; + register in vim)
- Changed p to paste from clipboard using the weechat xsel script (which I've modified to use clipboard)
- Modified for colemak (n and e for up and down)
- Set f to do link hinting with termite using shell.py to send link hint key combo (vimode now has ! for shell commands though)
- Added some other custom bindings (i.e. for buffer switching with space prefix bindings)
- Added tmux bindings

## Rest of Default Readme:

You can view this help text inside WeeChat by typing `/vimode`

# Description:
Add vi/vim-like modes and keybindings to WeeChat.

# Usage:
To switch to Normal mode, press `Esc` or `Ctrl+Space`.

Two bar items are provided:

* **mode_indicator**: shows the currently active mode (e.g. `NORMAL`).
* **vi_buffer**: shows partial commands (e.g. `df`).

You can add them to your input bar. For example, using `iset.pl`:

* `/iset weechat.bar.input.items`
* `<Alt+Enter>`
* Add `[mode_indicator]+` at the start, and `,[vi_buffer]` at the end.
* Final result example:
    `"[mode_indicator]+[input_prompt]+(away),[input_search],
    [input_paste],input_text,[vi_buffer]"`

To switch back to Insert mode, you can use i, a, A, etc.

To execute an Ex command, simply precede it with a ':' while in normal mode,
for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".

# History:
* version 0.1:      initial release
* version 0.2:      added esc to switch to normal mode, various key bindings
                    and commands.
* version 0.2.1:    fixes/refactoring
* version 0.3:      separate operators from motions and better handling. Added
                    yank operator, I/p. Other fixes and improvements. The
                    Escape key should work flawlessly on WeeChat ≥ 0.4.4.
* version 0.4:      added: f, F, t, T, r, R, W, E, B, gt, gT, J, K, ge, gE, X,
                    ~, ^^, ^Wh, ^Wj, ^Wk, ^Wl, ^W=, ^Wx, ^Ws, ^Wv, ^Wq, :!cmd.
                    Improved substitutions (:s/foo/bar). Rewrote key handling
                    logic to take advantage of WeeChat API additions.
                    Many fixes and improvements. WeeChat ≥ 1.0.0 required.
