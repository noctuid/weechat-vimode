Just forked this since I'll be using my own customized bindings..
Great idea; great script

.Changed p to paste from clipboard using the weechat xsel script (which I've modified to use clipboard)

.Modified for colemak (n and e for up and down)

.Set f to do link hinting with termite using shell.py to send link hint key combo
